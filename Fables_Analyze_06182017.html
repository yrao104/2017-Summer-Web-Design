	<p>This fable tries to demonstrate that overconfidence and vanity hinder valuable relationships and good 	friendships.People that show these kinds of qualities tend to not have as many long-lasting relationships. This in turn 	causes people to drift away from them and they tend to be loners. Personally, I like to have a lot of friends and make an 	extra effort to please everybody. This has its own set of repercussions because I do get hurt in the process. Clearly, 	each person is unique in their own way and patience and humility are good virtues that people should try to follow.</p>
