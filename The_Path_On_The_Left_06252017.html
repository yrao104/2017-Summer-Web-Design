    <h1>The Path on the Left</h1>
      <p>Great job! You crossed the path without falling into the boiling lava and stabbed all the snakes that came in your way. You look up and see an avalanche of rocks falling towards you. You can either jump on to a steep ledge to save yourself or enter a secret passageway to your right.</p>
