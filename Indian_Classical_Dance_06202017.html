      <h1><b>Indian Classical Dance</b></h1> 
        <h2>Bharatanatyam</h2>

	<p>Bharatanatyam originated first in Tamil Nadu. It is mostly danced by women, but some men also practice this ancient 			art form of Bharatanatayam. Bharatanatayam is one of India's oldest traditions that people like to pass from generation 		to generation. While dancing Bharatanatayam, dancers usually have a straight upper torso, special footwork, and use hand 		gestures to represent different things in Hindu mythology. To further connect with the audience, dancers depict 			expressions through their eyes, body language, and face. Bharatanatyam is usually accompanied by a singer, a violin 			player, and a mridangam(indian percussion instrument) artist.</p>
