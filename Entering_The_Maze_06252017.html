      <p>Hello, brave soul. You have now entered The Maze of Horror and are faced with a forked path. The path on the right is covered with sharp rocks, thorns, and poison ivy. The path in the center is extremeley steep and has a creek infested with piranhas and crocodiles. The path on the left has venomous snakes. Which path will you take?</p>
